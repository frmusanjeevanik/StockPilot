## Key Components

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Problem**: Secure access control for different user roles
- **Solution**: Custom authentication with password hashing and session management
- **Roles**: Admin, Initiator, Reviewer, Approver, Legal Reviewer, Action Closure Authority
- **Security**: SHA-256 password hashing with role-based decorators

### Case Management Workflow
- **Problem**: Track cases through multiple approval stages
- **Solution**: Status-based workflow system with role-specific interfaces
- **Statuses**: Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Approved, Rejected, Legal Review, Closed
- **Features**: Case creation, document upload, comments, status transitions

### Document Management
- **Problem**: Handle supporting documents for cases
- **Solution**: File upload system with unique naming and metadata storage
- **Storage**: Local uploads directory with UUID-based naming
- **Metadata**: File size, original filename, upload timestamp tracking

### Audit System
- **Problem**: Track all case modifications and user actions
- **Solution**: Comprehensive audit logging with timestamps and user attribution
- **Coverage**: Case creation, status changes, comments, document uploads

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Problem**: Provide insights into case management performance
- **Solution**: Interactive dashboards with Plotly visualizations
- **Features**: Case statistics, status distribution, export capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Case Creation**: Initiators create cases with supporting documents
2. **Review Process**: Reviewers examine cases and provide feedback
3. **Approval Workflow**: Approvers make final decisions on reviewed cases
4. **Legal Review**: Legal reviewers handle compliance aspects
5. **Case Closure**: Action Closure Authorities finalize completed cases
6. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with user attribution and timestamps
